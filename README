perv watches your project directories and logs events to help you keep track
of your time.

to get started, create an empty database for perv and then copy 
default.config.json to config.json, editing it to contain access details
for your database, the absolute path to the root directory of the tree you want
to watch, and also the port you want the 'viewer' web app to run on.

to begin logging events, run 'node perv-watcher.js'. to view logged events,
run 'node perv-viewer.js' and point your web browser to the machine and port
you're running the viewer on.
